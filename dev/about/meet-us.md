## Our Mission
- Provision of STEM education through free, creative, and hands-on skills development programs to encourage females, visible minorities, and underserved youths to pursue  science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers.

- Provision of a one-to-one mentoring program to foster skill development, career guidance, risk management and feedback provision, to females and visible minority STEM professionals and entrepreneurs.

## Why STEMHub Foundation?
- Women are always less likely to choose a STEM program, regardless of mathematical ability.  In addition, women in STEM careers are  underpaid when compared to their male counterpart. 

- Visible minorities hold only 4.6% of leadership roles in Canadian organizations despite having 66.3% of their population in the labour force.

### Founder & Creative Director
Dr. Olubamiji beats the circle of poverty through education to become the first black person to obtain a PhD in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Saskatchewan in  2017.  As such, she has first-hand knowledge of how limited access to funds, exposure to dangerous neighborhoods and being a woman can be a barrier to becoming a good citizen. 

As a trailblazer and scientist specializing in cutting-edge additive manufacturing (3D-printing) of metal and plastic components for demanding industrial applications, she has a deep understanding of the role of mentorship in career projections. Dr. Olubamiji was recently nominated as a 2018 Woman of Inspiration by the Canadian Business chicks. Some of her other awards include 2018 Ondo state Female Role Model, 2018 STEM Power Award Recipient at the STEM Power Conference, Lagos, named one of Canada’s 150 black women making Canada better by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for the celebration of Canada at 150, and 2017 Woman of Outstanding Achievement in Education by the Nigerian-Canadian Association.

Alongside publishing her work in academic journals, Dr. Olubamiji is a frequent speaker and panelist at international STEM conventions, congresses and conferences around the world. She has also been featured on various media platforms including Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) National Public Radio (NPR), Guardian Nigeria, Nigerian Tribune, Punch Newspaper, City People Nigeria, and over 100 online news / media platforms. 

Prior to establishing STEMHub Foundation, Dr. Olubamiji dedicated her time to promoting student engagement, inclusion and diversity, mentoring and empowering youths and women working and studying in STEM related disciplines by volunteering. She has volunteered with organizations such as the Empowerment of African Women Organization Finland; Food for the Hungry,  Saskatoon, Canada; Let’s Talk Science Canada; Engineering Graduate Community Council, University of Saskatchewan; Yoruba Heritage School Saskatoon; the African Experience Toronto, Canada and so on.
