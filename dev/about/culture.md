*AHA - Autonomy, Humility & Ambition* 

Everything that we do, we believe in thinking differently to make a difference. We believe in challenging ourselves to surpass our current best. 

We are ambitious. We aim for the best. With this Ambition comes humility. We believe that humility is sexy. Additionally, we empower and support each other to work autonomously.

If you love working with the latest technology and tools with a great autonomous, humble and ambitious team,  Lush Plans is a place for you.

## What we do

We take real world events and vendor data and research, and turn them into meaningful insights for providing the best event vendor for any event. What this does is that it allows Vendors of different sizes to be seen and it gives couples and other event organizers the best vendors at the best prices. We have gathered data of more than 13, 000 Nigerian wedding Vendors and we are able to tell and predict the top vendors, top vendors by type etc.

We're now working with individual vendors to take the events deals and combine them with the deals of other event vendors to produce the best event package for any event.

Each recommended event package is unique because the needs of each event is unique and we are combining the event preferences with the data that we have.
