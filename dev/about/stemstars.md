STEMstars is a mentee-driven one-to-one mentoring program that strategically pairs mentees with mentors based on career needs, and goals. Our mentors voluntarily serve as role models, provide skill development advice, risk management, career guidance, share their knowledge, experience, and connection to help our mentees sharpen their skills, get creative and achieve their career goals.

## How Does STEMStars Work?
- Mentees will be in contact with their mentors once per month for one hour. 

- Mentees submit a progress report a week prior to the monthly meetings via email and schedule a meeting with their mentors as convenient for the pair.

- STEMHub Foundation team conducts quarterly appraisal to examine the relationship and provides ongoing direct support to the pairs who have questions, concerns and minor financial needs.
