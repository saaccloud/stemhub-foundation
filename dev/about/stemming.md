STEMing delivers creative, free, hands-on and minds-on STEM workshops on various STEM topics to students (Grade 2 -12) in visible-minority-dominated, female-dominated and underserved communities across the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Ontario, Canada.

Just like scientists, we believe young people can imagine, question, design, create, test, improve and fall in love with STEM in a fun-filled learning environment under the guidance of skilled instructors.

Our workshops are tailored to encourage curiosity about STEM, help young people develop useful skills and the right attitude towards STEM careers, and provide guidance to help young people understand how STEM shapes our daily lives.
